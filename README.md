# carauction


Playground simulates the entire blockchain network within the browser by providing a sandpit
environment to define, test, and explore business networks defined by using Composer.The car auction business network has a set of known participants (buyers and sellers), assets (cars and
car listings), and transactions (placing bids and closing auctions). We will model these by using
Hyperledger Composer and test the business logic that makes the auction work.
